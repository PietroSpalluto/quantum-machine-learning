A Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC based on a parametrized quantum circuit) and a Quantum SVC (QSVC) are trained on the 'penguins' dataset containing 7 features and 345 samples.
Different configurations of the VQC and different optimizers are tested to find the best one.
A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to find a suitable feature map to embed classical data into a Hilbert space.
